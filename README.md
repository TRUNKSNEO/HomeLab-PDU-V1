# **MiniLab PSU** - 5 Port Homelab USB-C PD Power Supply
MiniLab PSU is a power delivery solution for micro PC clusters and homelabs that fits in a 1U 10-inch rack. It's built around a 300W Meanwell PSU featuring 5 USB-C power delivery ports and active cooling.

Mini and micro labs are a great solution for homelabbing, but the power delivery options are often bulky and hard to manage due to the need for an individual power brick per computer.
This project addressess this by consolidating power delivery for up to five 65W micro PCs into a single unit that fits in a standard 1U 10-inch rack mount. This differs from a conventional multi-port USB PD hub by not needing to re-negotiate any power delivery voltages when a unit is turned off or unpluggded, or when the power load across ports changes drastically. Also the packing is designed specifially with rack mounting in mind, with active cooling and power switching.

## Features:
- 1U
- Both 19" and 10" variants
- Up to 10 x 65W USB-C outputs
- Active cooling
- Sheet metal housing or fully 3D printable


## PCB: ##
The PCB is 2 layers and 1.6mm. "PCB/1U Minilab PSU V2" folder contains the production files, which can be uploaded to a PCB service like JLCPCB or PCBWAY. PCB assembly is recommended unless you have capability to do reflow, or hot air soldering.
There is currently no option for a through-hole variant because the tranistor does not come in that package.

## Housing: ##
All variants of housing can be found in the CAD folder, 

## Cooling: ##
Switched 24V is stepped down via an LM2596 to power chassis fans. The PCB has 2 fan headers, one for the PCB fan and an optional header for swapping out the PSU fan if it's too loud.
